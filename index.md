# About me

{: .fs-6 }
Hey, my dear friends, nice to meet you here. This is my playground for learning and recording tech, like Book Reading, Cyber Security, and Coding. If you’re interested in what I’ve written, feel free to leave your thoughts. Your feedback helps me improve and share more. Thanks for stopping by!

I am reading a book named 《the ARTIST's WAY-A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity》,this magic book inspired me to make this site of my technical blog. You can find CyberSecurity and ordinary tech records or some interesing book conclusion I ever maked during the days passed.
