# About me

{: .fs-6 }
Hey, my dear friends, nice to meet you here. This is my playground for learning and recording tech, like Book Reading, Cyber Security, and Coding. If you’re interested in what I’ve written, feel free to leave your thoughts. Your feedback helps me improve and share more. Thanks for stopping by!

I am reading a book named 《the ARTIST's WAY-A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity》,this magic book inspired me to make this site of my technical blog. You can find CyberSecurity and ordinary tech records or some interesing book conclusion I ever maked during the days passed.

> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of the Just the Docs theme. See [the CHANGELOG]({% link CHANGELOG.md %}) for a list of releases, new features, and bug fixes.

Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme.
